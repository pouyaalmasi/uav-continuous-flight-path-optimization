# UAV Flight Path Optimization for Infrastructure Inspection

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for infrastructure inspection, especially bridges, due to their flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, effective deployment requires optimized flight planning because of the **limited battery lifetime** of most UAVs.

This project proposes a **novel meta-heuristic-driven continuous flight path optimization method** for area coverage in UAV-based inspections. The method addresses critical challenges such as:

- **Battery efficiency** – maximizing inspection coverage while minimizing power consumption  
- **Flight time reduction** – reducing overall mission duration  
- **Constraint satisfaction** – ensuring full coverage, overlap, and obstacle avoidance  

## Key Contributions
- Developed a **continuous search space approach** for generating more optimal flight paths (unlike traditional discrete approaches).  
- Implemented and compared **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for solving the flight path optimization problem.  
- Objective function targets **minimizing flight length and battery usage** while meeting inspection requirements.  
- Validated across different scenarios.  

## Results
- Up to **75% reduction in energy consumption** (based on flight time).  
- Up to **80% reduction in total flight length**.  
- Demonstrated robust performance under various inspection scenarios.  

## Applications
- Bridge inspection  
- Other infrastructure monitoring tasks requiring autonomous UAV coverage
